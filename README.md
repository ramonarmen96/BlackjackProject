### Lessons learned
I know that I repeated myself throughout the program,
and after going back through it I was able to remove
some extra code. I had an issue where If the player
lost and chose not to play anymore I got some exception errors.
I had a hard time getting the actual cards dealt, but once I
got past that every obstacle was a quick one in comparison.

I was getting frustrated because I could not figure out where to
start, but once I got past that I really enjoyed moving through it.
